When using the Morse Code Telegraph Keyboard as a custom keyboard, no information at all about your usage is stored on device or transmitted over the network to the creator of the keyboard. If you optionally choose to enable "Full Access" to turn on sound effects, we also do not store any data about your keyboard usage or what you type. We don't want anything to do with your data.
