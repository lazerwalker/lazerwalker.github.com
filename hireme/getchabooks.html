          <p>Buying college textbooks is frustrating. The school bookstore is convenient but expensive; online
            comparison shopping online is cheap, but time-consuming.</p>

          <p>In college, two of my friends and I built a comparison shopping engine that let students look up their
            books by entering what courses they were taking. Although we all had a hand in all parts of the business, I
            was roughly in charge of the design of the product and the front-end codebase.</p>

          <h1>Process</h1>

          <p>The initial version of GetchaBooks was built over a period of 2-3 weeks. My co-founder Mike built the
            back-end while my other co-founder Ricky and I paired on the design and code for the front-end.</p>

          <p>After launching at two schools as a pilot program, we were able to interview users and perform in-person
            user testing to gather feedback about what worked and what didn't. Based on the set of personas that came
            out of that, we began to fine-tune and redesign the site so that it could better suit those different needs,
            including a visual redesign and a complete overhaul of the results page.</p>

          <div class='images portfolio-images threes zoomable'>
            <a href="images/getchabooks/school.jpg" target="_blank" class="viewable img"><img
                src="images/getchabooks/school.jpg" /></a>
            <a href="images/getchabooks/courses.png" target="_blank" class="viewable img"><img
                src="images/getchabooks/courses.png" /></a>
            <a href="images/getchabooks/results.png" target="_blank" class="viewable img"><img
                src="images/getchabooks/results.png" /></a>
          </div>

          <p>The new version of the product launched at hundreds of schools, rather than the two we initially supported.
            A custom-built analytics system I built let us use our larger userbase to fine-tune the site with A/B
            testing and other mechanisms of data-driven decision making over the next couple of years.</p>

          <h1>Results</h1>
          <p>At the peak of our success, we were used by students at over a thousand universities across America. At
            Tufts University (our "home base") over 60% of the undergraduate student body used GetchaBooks to buy their
            textbooks. We were featured in publications such as <a
              href="http://www.inc.com/coolest-college-start-ups-2011/getchabooks.html">Inc. Magazine</a> and the <a
              href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/finding-cheaper-textbooks-2nd-edition/">NY Times</a>.</p>

          While GetchaBooks is no longer live, the entire application has been open-sourced on <a
            href="https://github.com/getchabooks/getchabooks">GitHub</a>.
