        <section>
          <p>The SF Playhouse is a small theatre company in San Francisco.</p>

          <p>To manage ticket sales and customer information, they were using a piece of custom software designed and
            built by a former volunteer. Due to a combination of technical limitations and a design ill-suited to the
            employees' actual workflow, the average transaction time using the software was very high. Given that most
            transactions took place in real-time while a customer waited on the phone, this was unacceptable.</p>

          <p>The theater was in an awkward place: they had outgrown their current tools, but couldn't yet afford
            commercial box office management software. While I wasn't allowed to modify the current client or migrate
            the existing data into a more modern database, I was able to create a new client that directly accessed the
            existing database backend.</p>


          <h1>Process</h1>
          <p>I had the benefit of being embedded within the team that would actually be using the software. I began by
            interviewing the staff and shadowing them as they went about their daily work to figure out what their needs
            were.</p>

          <p>I identified two main tasks that represented the bulk of the system’s use: taking orders over the phone and
            printing out customer lists for each evening’s performance. These two tasks became the focus of the new
            interface. Working so closely with the end users meant that after shipping an initial version I was able to
            continue to closely observe how they used it and make more finessed adjustments.</p>

          <p>I also worked with the artistic director to create a mobile version of the site optimized for his needs. As
            a small theater, a large part of their marketing and development strategy was his personal relationship with
            the theatre's regular patrons. In the time before each performance started, he would walk around the theatre
            saying hello to subscribers and board members.</p>

          <p>During the course of one of these pre-show sessions, he would frequently run back into the box office to
            ask us to look up ticket information for a patron located in a certain seat. Building him a mobile-optimized
            version of the web app seemed like the perfect solution, allowing him to look up the information he needed
            easily while in the house, while minimizing the development time that a native app would have demanded.</p>

          <h1>Results</h1>
          <p>After deploying my software, the average transaction time was halved, bringing it well within an acceptable
            range. Other important daily tasks the box office staff performed were also made much quicker.</p>

          <p>Building the whole thing as a light-weight web app minimized my development time and allowed me to move on
            to other projects for the company, which was important given the necessary impermanence of my solution.</p>
