          <p>Scribe is a web-based sheet music notation program.</p>

          <p>When I began work on Scribe, I was preparing to go to grad school for music composition. As a composer, I
            was frustrated by most modern sheet music notation software. The most popular programs are chiefly targeted
            at professional copyists and publishers, with interfaces optimized for fine-grained control over layout and
            typography. While this is great for publishers, it results in a subpar experience for composers.</p>

          <p>I built Scribe as a proof-of-concept for an interface more suited to composers and songwriters, letting
            them focusing on the content of their music rather than its presentation.</p>

          <h1>Process</h1>
          <p>Scribe began as a series of rough HTML prototypes experimenting with different forms of inputting notes via
            multitouch on the iPad. I jumped straight into code, sketching in CSS rather than paper. I was trying to see
            what could come out of a conscious radical departure from current sheet music software interface
            conventions.</p>

          <div class='images portfolio-images zoomable'>
            <a href="images/scribe/earliest.png" target="_blank" class="viewable img"><img
                src='images/scribe/earliest.png' /></a>
            <a href="images/scribe/earlier.png" target="_blank" class="viewable img"><img
                src='images/scribe/earlier.png' /></a>
          </div>

          <p>As a composer myself, I was initially the only user of the app. As I became convinced of its viability, I
            began conducting user research to see where my assumptions about other people's compositional processes were
            wrong. I observed composers using existing software, getting a good sense of others' workflows and
            notational needs.</p>

          <p>As a result, I began to focus on creating an experience that would work for both iPad and desktop, rather
            than chiefly the iPad.</p>

          <div class='images portfolio-images zoomable'>
            <a href="images/scribe/recent-editor.png" target="_blank" class="viewable img"><img
                src='images/scribe/recent-editor.png' /></a>
            <a href="images/scribe/recent-editor-key.png" target="_blank" class="viewable img"><img
                src='images/scribe/recent-editor-key.png' /></a>
          </div>

          <p></p>

          <h1>Result</h1>
          <p>A live prototype of Scribe is available at <a
              href="http://scribeapp.herokuapp.com">http://scribeapp.herokuapp.com</a>.
