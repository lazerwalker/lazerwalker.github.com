        <h2>Bard Shuttle Schedule</h2>

        <section>
          <p>While attending Bard College, I was approached by the administration to create an iPhone app to display the
            schedule for the school's free on-campus shuttle. Most students who relied on the shuttle either carried
            around paper timetables or used their smartphones to awkwardly look up the PDF timetable located online;
            success for the project simply meant providing an easier way.</p>

          <h1>Process</h1>

          <p>After interviewing students who used the shuttle regularly, it became overwhelmingly clear there were three
            main groups of shuttle users: students who lived off-campus and used the shuttle every day to commute,
            students who used the shuttle occasionally to go shopping in the nearby town, and students wanting to go
            party off-campus on the weekend.</p>

          <p>The first group already had the schedule more or less memorized. The second two groups were both concerned
            mostly with near-term schedules: they almost exclusively wanted to find out when the immediate next shuttle
            was from their current location to somewhere else, and then when the return shuttles were. Amusingly, the
            most common use case was students at the local bar wanting to know when the last shuttle back to campus
            would be.</p>

          <div class='images'>
            <img src='images/bardshuttle/wireframe-1.png' />
            <!--img src='images/bardshuttle/wireframe-1a.png'/-->
            <img src='images/bardshuttle/wireframe-2.png' />
            <img src='images/bardshuttle/wireframe-3.png' />
            <img src='images/bardshuttle/wireframe-4.png' />
            <!--img src='images/bardshuttle/wireframe-4a.png'/-->
          </div>

          <p>Given that, I sketched some rough wireframes centered around emphasizing the shuttle stops students were
            most likely to use. Large, visually distinctive icons representing well-known campus landmarks arranged in a
            familiar grid pattern (the same pattern used at the time by apps such as Facebook) ensured that even the
            most inebriated of riders would have no trouble finding the information they needed.</p>

          <h1>Product</h1>

          <p>After releasing the initial version of the app on the App Store, within a semester the app had been
            downloadedby more than 1/3 of the student body. This is particularly impressive considering the app was only
            available for the iPhone.</p>

          <p></p>
