          <h1>Hi. I'm Mike.</h1>
          <h1>I make apps for web and mobile. I want to use those skills to solve your business problems.</h1>

          <p>I've been building software professionally for nearly ten years, at places like <a
              href="https://pivotal.io">Pivotal</a> and the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a> and
            working on products like <a href="https://wordswithfriends.com">Words With Friends</a>, <a
              href="https://timehop.com">Timehop</a>, and <a href="https://etsy.com">Etsy</a>. I mostly work on rich web
            apps, native iOS apps, and custom hardware.</p>

          <p>If you're interested in working together, shoot me an email at <a
              href="mailto:hireme@lazerwalker.com">hireme@lazerwalker.com</a>.</p>

          <h2>What I Do </h2>

          <p><strong>Build rapid prototypes and MVPs</strong>. Whether you know what needs to be built or are still
            exploring a possibility space, I can help get you get your product to a v1 as quickly as possible. The work
            I do often spans the whole spectrum from design to product to full-stack development. I have particular
            expertise in prototyping novel interfaces and interactions in cross-platform JavaScript, most notably those
            taking advantage of smartphone data sensors (e.g. geolocation and motion).</p>

          <p><strong>Write high-quality, sustainable code</strong>. Need an extra hand on your app? I can serve as staff
            augmentation to build out new functionality quickly and robustly, or help whip your more troublesome
            codebase into shape. I also have experience mentoring clients on engineering and product process, aiding
            adoption of techniques like test-driven development and pair programming.</p>

          <p><strong>Make playful things</strong>. I make games and toys with novel interaction methods, particularly
            experiences combining the digital and the physical. My work has been featured everywhere from alt.ctrl.GDC
            and IndieCade (as a finalist) to the Smithsonian Museum of Art and NPR's All Things Considered. While at the
            MIT Media Lab, my research (in collaboration with the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a Pulitzer-nominated
            playwright) focused on using fiction to connect people to real-world spaces. Check out my <a
              href="http://lazerwalker.com">portfolio</a> for examples.</p>

          <h2>Who I've Worked For</h2>

          <p><strong>Some of my former clients and employers</strong> include Cover, Electric Objects, Etsy, Lore,
            Rotunda Software, SF Playhouse, Sensible Object, Timehop, XO Group, Zulip (acquired by Dropbox), and Zynga.
            I've worked on projects like:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://voiceoriginals.com">Voice Originals</a> / <a
                href="http://voiceoriginals.com/wheninrome/">When In Rome</a>: Design and development for tabletop games
              augmented with Amazon Alexa</li>
            <li><a href="https://20daystranger.net">Twenty Day Stranger</a>: Design and development in collaboration
              with the MIT Media Lab and the Dalai Lama Center for Transformative Ethics and Values.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.electricobjects.com">Electric Objects</a>: I built the original pre-release iOS app
              that went out to Kickstarter backers</li>
            <li><a href="https://timehop.com">Timehop</a>: I led development, from initial design prototypes to v1 on
              the app store, of the original Timehop iOS app.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WordsWithFriends">Words With Friends</a>: I helped launch the Facebook
              HTML5 version of the game, and built/maintained the mobile HTML5 port.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This is on top of a rich portfolio of personal projects and commercial products, ranging from a <a
              href="http://blog.lazerwalker.com/2015/06/25/location-as-intent-introducing-cortado.html">location-aware
              caffeine-tracking app</a> to <a href="https://bit.ly/15q7ZXz">one of the most popular third-party NYC
              bikeshare apps</a> to a <a href="https://lazerwalker.com/hellooperator">game played on a 90-year-old
              telephone switchboard</a>. See <a href="https://lazerwalker.com">my portfolio</a> for more info.</p>


          <p><strong>As a writer and speaker</strong>, I've contributed for popular iOS publications such as <a
              href="https://nshipster.com">NSHipster</a> and <a href="https://objc.io">objc.io</a>. My site <a
              href="http://fuckingblocksyntax.com">Fucking Block Syntax</a> is one of relatively few external community
            documentation resources taught internally in Apple training courses.</p>

          <p><strong>As an open-source contributor</strong>, I regularly contribute to impactful OSS projects such as <a
              href="https://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a>. Projects of my own, such as <a
              href="https://github.com/intentkit/IntentKit">IntentKit</a>, are used by thousands of developers in the
            iOS and web dev communities. Most recently, I've been <a
              href="https://twitch.tv/lzrwkr">Twitch-streaming</a> live development of a domain specific language and JS
            runtime engine for interactive narrative in AR/MR. See my <a
              href="https://github.com/lazerwalker">GitHub</a> profile for more.</p>


          <h2>How I Work</h2>

          <p>I use whatever tools are appropriate for the job. On mobile, this usually means native Swift (or Obj-C)
            code; on the web, Rails or Node on the back-end and modern JS technologies such as React on the front-end.
            In general, I:</p>

          <p><strong>Deliver working software</strong>. Putting a flawed prototype in the hands of real users answers
            questions that user interviews or low-fidelity testing often can't. I deliver working software early and
            often.</p>

          <p><strong>Sketch directly in code</strong>. A tight feedback loop for iterating quickly is easiest when
            working in software rather than static artifacts. When doing design work, I prefer experimenting straight in
            code.</p>

          <p><strong>Measure, but only to a point</strong>. I've worked in metrics-driven environments. I once increased
            installs 40% on a Facebook game with 4 million DAU in a single A/B test. But data-driven design that can
            only take you so far. Knowing how and what to test can make your product better; knowing when to rely on
            intuition instead of numbers is just as important.</p>

          <p><strong>Seek active collaboration</strong>. Talking about "my work" vs "your work" gets in the way of
            building the best possible product. I believe the best work comes from tight-knit, ego-less collaboration.
          </p>
