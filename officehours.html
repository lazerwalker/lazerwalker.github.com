                <h1>Cloud Game Dev Open Office Hours</h1>

                <p>As a developer advocate at Microsoft, my job is to help game developers make games more effectively. As part of that, I want to help YOU personally!</p>

                <p>I'm offering "office hours" where anyone can book a half-hour with me to chat about game dev. I'm particularly excited to hear from folks who identify as belonging to a marginalized or underrepresented group in the games industry!</p>

                <p>I'm here to talk about whatever's most useful for you. That said, here are some areas I can likely be particularly helpful:</p>
                
                <h2>Adding cloud services to your game</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Is this your first time adding any sort of online component to your game that isn't just platform-specific cloud saves or achievements? Are you trying to figure out how to shift from making a premium boxed game to a live service game? Do you just want something like analytics or leaderboards and don't quite know where to start? I'm happy to help walk you through the lay of the land, or give you a gut-check for your architecture if you've already got something in-place.</p>
                <li>I've been the sole engineer responsible for live games with tens to hundreds of thousands of DAU, and I've designed F2P games with a deeply concerned eye towards grappling with avoiding unethical and predatory practices. Wherever you are on your LiveOps journey (or if you viscerally hate the term "LiveOps") I can help!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Using DevOps tooling and building your games on the cloud</h2>
                <p></p>
                  <li>DevOps tooling and how to improve the build systems and processes you're using for your games. I do a lot of work with cloud-based build systems!</li>
                  <li>Project management. I have a background in formal Agile consulting, but I won't tell you to use capital-A Agile on your indie game. That means I <em>do</em> have a lot of experience talking through project management techniques and knowledge of different strategies and tactics, though!</li>
            </p>

            <h2>General game dev help</h2>
                  <li>Career advice, especially for earlier-career folks</li>
                  <li>The business of indie games. I've run a studio and raised traditional venture funding before!</li>
                  <li>General game development or design questions. I'm most experienced at procedural content generation and designing/using non-traditional game interfaces, but I'm happy to be a generally smart and experienced game design sounding board!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>This is not a sales call.</h2>
                <p>This time is sponsored by my employer, Microsoft. My job is doing developer advocacy for cloud services, which is why a lot of the suggested topics above focus on either games-focused LiveOps tools like PlayFab or adopting general cloud-based developer tools. However, my job is to help game devs, not sell to them. This will not be a sales call to convince you to adopt Azure/PlayFab/GitHub/any other MS tool. If we've ever interacted before, you know that I'm here to help the indie game dev community more than anything. I'm truly happy to help however I can, even if we don't even mention cloud services. Heck, depending on what we're talking about, I might explicitly tell you to use a competitor. I love it when that happens, it gives me ammunition to go back to my product team contacts in Xbox and Azure and be like "here's concrete evidence you built the wrong thing for this audience".</p>

                <h2>How do I book?</h2>
                <p>For now, the times available are limited to Fridays, in EST working hours, with a limited number of slots per week. If this time block consistently doesn't work for you, drop me a note (any of email, Twitter, or Mastodon work) and I'll see what I can do.</p>
