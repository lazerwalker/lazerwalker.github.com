This is the source for my personal website, http://www.lazerwalker.com.

The site layout is done using a minimal port of Blueprint's grid system 
from CSS to SCSS. This means the grid is created purely in CSS, leaving
the HTML completely free of non-semantic markup.

Other than that, everything's pretty straight-forward; nothing particularly 
ground-breaking, but there are pretty clean implementations of some nifty 
parts of the HTML5 spec (CSS3 media queries to create a responsive layout, 
semantic markup tags like for sections, etc).
