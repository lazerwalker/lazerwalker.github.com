This is the source for my personal website, http://www.lazerwalker.com.

The site layout is done using [Orbital](http://github.com/lazerwalker/orbital), a Sass grid framework I wrote for [Lore](http://lore.com).

Other than that, everything's pretty straight-forward. Don't expect anything groundbreaking, just a nice simple responsive static web site built with Sass, HTML5, and the merest sprinkling of JavaScript as a garnish.
